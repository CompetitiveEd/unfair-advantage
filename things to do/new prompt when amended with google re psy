Counter-Intelligence.PART 1: THE FIVE AUDIENCE TESTSFor each test, be specific — name pages, sections, and exact text that works or fails.TEST 1: THE EXPERIENCED SELLER (10-25 years, £5M-£100M deals)Would they bookmark this and actually use the prompts in live deals? Or read it once and forget?Do the "Honest Failures" (e.g., The Green SLA Trap, The Support Staff Signal) ring true? Would a seller nod and say "that's happened to me"?Is the Meridian Financial Services worked example realistic? Does it feel like a real deal in a real regulated industry?Week-by-week: does the complexity genuinely escalate?TEST 2: THE CXO (VP Sales, CRO, MD, or CEO)Reading this site, would a CXO think "I want this person running my commercial team"?The Blueprint Check: Does the £50M case study on blueprint.html successfully prove that GAIN is a "proven industrial engine" and not just a tech toy?Does the site demonstrate strategic thinking (methodology design, framework architecture, P&L awareness) or just tactical execution?Does the "Sandhurst Influence Model" (Sphere of Control vs. Sphere of Influence) signal leadership capability?TEST 3: THE RECRUITERWould a recruiter send this link to a hiring manager as proof of capability for a Sales Director / VP Sales / CRO role?Does the "Strategic Operator" bio on the homepage anchor the candidate's authority immediately?Is there enough evidence of results (via the Blueprint page) to satisfy "show me the numbers" scrutiny?TEST 4: THE "PRETENTIOUSNESS" TESTWe use heavy terms like "Epistemology," "Ontology," and "Pedigree." Does this sound like a high-level strategic operator, or does it sound like an arrogant consultant?Does the "Sandhurst / Military Intelligence" framing feel authentic and disciplined, or does it feel like "stolen valor" / trying too hard?Be brutal: does the tone command respect or roll eyes?TEST 5: THE AGE BIAS TESTDoes the "Low-Latency vs. High-Latency" framing on the Origins page successfully pivot "20 years experience" into a feature rather than a "legacy" bug?Does the design and AI fluency feel modern enough to counter any age bias?PART 2: SECTION-BY-SECTION CONTENT AUDITFor every major section on every page, answer these five questions.QuestionWhat you're checkingDoes this section earn its place?Not "is it good" but "should it exist at all?"Is it redundant?Same argument made elsewhere?Is it too long?Give a specific cut percentage. Name the text to cut.What's the ONE sentence a seller remembers?The Minto governing thought test.What specifically should be cut?Name the exact text.PART 3: THE 12 CONTENT PRINCIPLESFor each, provide: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL and one specific fix.AI DOES 80%, HUMAN DOES 20%: Does the site enforce the "Human in the Loop" (Judgment/Epistemology)?SKILL IS THE QUESTION: Does it teach structured inquiry (Layer 2) over generic prompting (Layer 1)?HONEST ABOUT LIMITATIONS: Are the "Honest Failures" specific and visceral (e.g., Hallucination = "Liar Label")?EXPERIENCE IS THE DIFFERENTIATOR: Do the "What Experience Sees" callouts add genuine insight?STEER, DON'T DRIFT: Is this philosophy embedded across all four weeks?SHOW, DON'T TELL: Are the Meridian/Helios examples detailed and consistent?CHAIN ARCHITECTURE: Is the logic flow (Data -> Map -> Narrative -> Growth) unbreakable?CREDIBILITY THROUGH HONESTY: Specific Check: Review the "Honest Failures" on Weeks 1-4. Do these specific examples ring true to an enterprise seller?PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY: Does Week 4 (Account Ecosystem) feel significantly harder than Week 1?DELIVERABLES: Does every step produce a usable document (Briefing, Map, Battle Card)?MAPS TO PRACTICE: Does it use standard sales artifacts (Annual Reports, Org Charts)?ACCESSIBLE: Is the vocabulary (e.g., Epistemology) defined quickly enough to not alienate the reader?PART 4: STRATEGIC NARRATIVE & CONSISTENCYSTORY COHERENCEDoes the arc hold? Homepage -> Foundations -> Steer -> Weeks 1-4 -> Blueprint -> Appendix.Does the Blueprint Page effectively bridge the gap between the "Manual Past" (2017) and the "AI Future" (2026)?MERIDIAN UNIVERSE CONSISTENCYAre all data points consistent? (Jennifer Morris = Director of Resilience? Budget £4.2M? The "47-minute gap" vs "47% improvement" distinction?)PART 5: THE VERDICTSSCORESTrojan horse effectiveness (1-10): How well does the site serve its dual purpose?CXO signal: Would a CXO reading this want to hire the author? Yes/No and why.Seller conversion: Would an experienced seller bookmark this and return? Yes/No and why.RANKINGSRank all pages from strongest to weakest.
