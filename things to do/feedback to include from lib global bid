Here is the amended section for the GAIN Prompt Architecture.

Based on our analysis of your "Digital Workplace" deck, I have created a new module called "THE ENGINEER LAYER". This sits logically between Week 2 (Mapping) and Week 3 (Winning).

You cannot write a winning response (Week 3) until you have modeled the logic and risk (The Engineer Layer).

Instructions for insertion:
Paste this entire block between Week 2 and Week 3 in the markdown file.

INTERLUDE: THE ENGINEER LAYER — MODEL THEM
"Logic, Risk, and Visuals before Words"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
Week 1 and 2 gave you the relationships. Week 3 gives you the words. But in complex technical bids (like global consolidations), "good words" don't win. Robust logic wins.

This module bridges the gap between "Sales Strategy" and "Technical Reality." It forces the AI to do what your expert architects did: build the mathematical models, the decision trees, and the commercial shields before you write a single page of the proposal.

THE PROMPT CHAIN (3 High-Value Engineering Prompts)
E-01: The "Placemat" Visualizer (The Slide 4 Playback)
Input: Week 1 Research + Week 2 Opportunity Context + RFP Scope

Output: A detailed description of the single "Before vs After" diagram that proves you understand the problem better than they do.

Why this matters: Executives don't read 50 pages. They look at one diagram. This prompt generates the "One Page" that validates their pain and sells your future state instantly.

ROLE: You are a Strategic Visualiser and Enterprise Architect. Your goal is
to synthesise a complex transformation into a SINGLE visual "placemat" that
an executive can understand in 30 seconds.

INPUTS:
- Client Current State (from RFP/Research): [PASTE]
- Client Goals/Future State: [PASTE]
- Key timelines and constraints: [PASTE]

Produce a VISUAL SPECIFICATION for a "Playback" slide:

1. THE "FROM" STATE (Visual Context)
   Describe the visual metaphor for their current pain.
   (e.g., "Fragmented silos," "Tangled wires," "Disconnected regions").
   List the specific data points to label (e.g., "28 Domains," "Inconsistent UX").

2. THE "TO" STATE (Visual Goal)
   Describe the visual metaphor for the solution.
   (e.g., "Unified hub," "Streamlined highway," "Single Identity").
   List the specific outcomes to label (e.g., "Single Domain," "Reduced Opex").

3. THE BRIDGE (The Transformation)
   How do we visually represent the journey?
   (e.g., "Phased migration stream," "The Discovery Filter").
   What are the 3-4 distinct phases to show on the arrow/timeline?

4. THE "YES" LABELS
   What specific client terms must appear on the diagram to make them nod?
   (e.g., if they call it "Project Voyager," the diagram must use that tag).

5. CAPTIONING
   Write the single sentence caption that goes at the bottom.
   Must summarize the ROI (e.g., "Consolidating 28 domains to deliver
   single-identity security and 30% opex reduction by 2018").
E-02: The Logic Engine (The Slide 23 Complexity Matrix)
Input: RFP Technical Requirements + Asset Lists

Output: A "Decision Tree" or "Complexity Matrix" that turns vague requirements into a quantifiably priced model.

Why this matters: Most bids fail because they treat all servers/users/apps the same. This prompt forces the AI to categorize complexity (Low/Med/High) just like your "Slide 23," ensuring you price for reality, not hope.

ROLE: You are a Technical Solution Architect and Risk Analyst. You are
designing the logic for a massive migration/transformation project.
Generic pricing will kill this bid. We need a "Decision Logic Matrix"
that categorizes complexity.

INPUTS:
- RFP Technical Scope / Requirements: [PASTE]
- Asset data (if available): [PASTE]
- Known constraints: [PASTE]

Produce a LOGIC ENGINE:

1. COMPLEXITY DRIVERS
   Identify the 5-7 technical factors that make a unit (server/app/user)
   hard to migrate.
   (e.g., Hard-coded IPs, Legacy OS, Third-party dependencies, Physical dongles).

2. THE DECISION TREE
   Create a logic flow:
   - IF [Condition A] THEN [Action B] (Cost = X)
   - IF [Condition C] THEN [Action D] (Cost = 3X)
   Example: "Is source code available? If NO -> Re-platforming required -> High Cost."

3. CLASSIFICATION MATRIX (The "T-Shirt Sizing")
   Define criteria for:
   - SIMPLE (Standard process, automated)
   - MEDIUM (Requires minor remediation)
   - COMPLEX (Requires manual re-architecture)
   - TOXIC (Out of scope / separate T&M project)

4. SCORING MECHANISM
   Assign a "risk score" to the drivers.
   (e.g., Base = 1. Hard-coded IP = +5. No Documentation = +10).
   This allows us to model the "unknowns" mathematically.
E-03: The Commercial Shield (The Slide 46 "Silent Killers")
Input: RFP Scope + The Logic Engine Output

Output: A list of "Silent Killers" (hidden costs), specific Exclusions, and "Consultative Status" disclaimers.

Why this matters: Winning the bid is useless if you lose money on the delivery. This prompt generates the commercial armour that protects your margin from "scope creep" and "data migration black holes."

ROLE: You are a Commercial Risk Officer and Senior Bid Lead. Your job is
to protect the firm from "Black Hole" risks—requirements that look simple
but have infinite cost depth (like "migrate all data" or "fix all legacy apps").

INPUTS:
- RFP Scope of Work: [PASTE]
- Technical Constraints (from Logic Engine): [PASTE]

Produce the COMMERCIAL SHIELD:

1. THE "SILENT KILLERS" LIST
   Identify 3-5 requirements in the RFP that look standard but carry
   massive hidden risk.
   (e.g., "Mailbox size 2GB" -> implies massive SAN upgrade if not tiered.
   "All applications" -> implies owning code remediation for 20-year-old apps).

2. DEFENSIVE DEFINITIONS (The "In/Out" Table)
   Draft the specific text for:
   - IN SCOPE (What we strictly control)
   - OUT OF SCOPE (The dangerous stuff: App upgrades, licensing, physical moves)
   - DEPENDENCIES (What the client MUST do for the price to hold)

3. THE "CONSULTATIVE STATUS" DISCLAIMER
   Draft a clause that defines our pricing as "Indicative based on assumptions"
   rather than "Fixed Price."
   Crucial phrase: "Only a detailed discovery phase will allow accurate cost detail."

4. ASSUMPTION LOG
   List the 5 critical assumptions that, if false, trigger a Change Control.
   (e.g., "Assumes administrative access is provided within 48 hours").
