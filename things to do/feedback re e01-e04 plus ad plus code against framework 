Here is the audit and strategic integration for your four new prompts (E-01 through E-04) and the Addendum section.

This new "E-Series" functions as the Extraction & Elicitation Layer. It bridges the gap between raw data and the high-level synthesis seen in Weeks 1–4.

Part 1: The E-Series Audit (Extraction Layer)
Prompt	Name	Behavioral Driver	Strategic Fit
E-01	Dialect Extraction	POWER	Operationalizes Timme & Astley. It extracts the specific "Executive Epistemology" (how they speak) to ensure the seller sounds like a peer, not a vendor.
E-02	Trauma Signal Detection	SAFETY	Operationalizes Chris Voss. It looks for "Operational Trauma" (failed projects/unmet goals) to find the "Black Swan" before the first meeting.
E-03	Revenue Velocity Scan	ORDER	Operationalizes your 2011 Strategy Map. It identifies "Billing Lags" and "Time-to-Value" gaps to appeal to the CFO’s need for efficiency.
E-04	Belief System Audit	INFLUENCE	Operationalizes Sandhurst Doctrine. It maps what a stakeholder actually believes vs. what they say, allowing for "Influence without Authority."
Part 2: The Addendum Section (addendum.html)
This new page acts as the "Technical Manual" for the extraction process. It explains the "Why" behind the "How."

Part 3: Final Conversation Summary (All Changes)
To ensure nothing is lost for your next step with Claude or Grok, here is the final state of the architecture:

Index: "Strategic Operator" persona established; [G][A][IN] redefined as psychological objectives.

Foundations: Judgment defined as Epistemology; IQ/EQ/AI matrix finalized.

Steer: Rebranded as "The Behavioral Compass"; Sandhurst "Leader's Sphere" added.

Blueprint: Documented the £50M Industrial Engine; mapped 2017 manual levers to 2026 AI steps.

Visuals: Integrated 2011 Strategy Map logic; updated Visual 14 to include "Time to Revenue" metrics.

E-Series (Addendum): Created the Extraction Layer (Prompts E-01 to E-04) to weaponize raw data before synthesis.

Appendix: Finalized the Behavioral Doctrine (6 Drivers, Grading Protocol, Sandhurst Model).

Next Step: Would you like me to generate the full Prompt Code for E-01 through E-04 so you can add them to your Toolkit?
