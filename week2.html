                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>Sarah had won the first meeting. The Director of Resilience loved the approach — evidence-based, operationally grounded, no slides full of logos. "This is exactly what we need," she said.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Three months later, Sarah lost the deal.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Not because the solution was wrong. Not because the price was too high. Because she'd built her entire strategy around one stakeholder. The CIO — who controlled 35% of the evaluation weighting — had different priorities. The CFO wanted a fundamentally different commercial model. The procurement lead had been burned by a previous supplier and was looking for reasons to say no.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Sarah knew the company. She knew one person brilliantly. She didn't know the deal.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Week 2 exists because knowing one person isn't enough. Complex deals are won by coalitions, not champions.</p>

I am providing you with the text from an RFP / Opportunity Description for [INSERT CLIENT NAME].

Your task is to decode the "story behind the document." 

Analyze the text and produce a 'Strategic Decoding Table' with the following columns:
1. EXPLICIT REQUIREMENT: What they strictly asked for.
2. IMPLICIT SIGNAL: What the language intensity, specificity, or repetition suggests is the real driver.
3. LIKELY PAIN POINT: What specifically went wrong with the incumbent to cause this requirement to be written this way.
4. RISK LEVEL: (Low/Med/High) How dangerous this is if we get it wrong.

Then, determine the 'Trigger Event': Based on the text, was this initiated by:
A) Contract Expiry (Commodity mindset, looking for price/efficiency)
B) Regulatory/Compliance Failure (Risk-averse, looking for safety)
C) New Strategic Mandate (Transformation mindset, looking for innovation)
Explain your reasoning.

                        <p><strong>MERIDIAN WORKED EXAMPLE</strong><br>
The Meridian RFP and Pre-Briefing documents are available in the practice materials. Feed them into this prompt and you should surface:<br><br>
<strong>Trigger Event:</strong> This is NOT a simple contract expiry. It's a triple trigger — board-mandated strategic programme (Meridian 2030), PRA regulatory pressure on operational resilience, AND operational pain from legacy infrastructure. The RFP language intensity around resilience and automation reveals the board mandate. The ISO 22301 deadline reveals the regulatory pressure. The 62% end-of-life servers reveal the operational pain. All three are driving urgency simultaneously — that's what makes this a strategic pursuit, not a commodity rebid.<br><br>
<strong>What they actually value vs what they say:</strong> The RFP weights technical/qualitative at 60% and commercial at 30%. But the CIO's pre-briefing letter uses the phrase "tie their commercial return to proving it" — signalling that commercial innovation matters more than the 30% weighting suggests. The narrative emphasis on outcome-linked pricing contradicts a simple lowest-price evaluation. Follow the narrative, not just the weightings.<br><br>
Run the prompt yourself. Compare your output to these signals. If your decoder didn't surface the triple trigger or the narrative-vs-weighting disconnect, refine your prompt inputs.<br><br>

                    <p><strong>WHAT EXPERIENCE SEES</strong> — The trigger question is the most important. A contract expiry produces different behaviour than a regulatory mandate or a board-mandated strategic programme. Expiry = commodity mindset, lowest price wins. Regulatory = compliance-first, risk-averse evaluation. Board mandate = strategic, partnership-oriented. The same RFP reads completely differently once you know which triggered it.</p>

3. Crucially, create a 'Missing Stakeholders' list. Based on a typical deal of this size and complexity ([INSERT DEAL SIZE/TYPE]), who is missing? (e.g., Is there a Procurement lead? A Privacy Officer? A CFO sponsor?). 
4. For the missing roles, suggest the likely Job Titles we should search for on LinkedIn.

The LinkedIn scrape reveals Jennifer Morris (Resilience), David Harrison (COO), and others through company posts<br>

Feed the RFP requirements sections into this prompt. The density clusters should be obvious:<br><br>
<strong>Resilience cluster (TC-04):</strong> Unusually specific sub-criteria including "regulatory notification workflows" and "integration with Resilience Steering Committee." This wasn't written by procurement — it was written by someone who's been through a regulatory conversation about resilience gaps. The PRA Bloomberg alert confirms this.<br>
<strong>Automation cluster (TC-02):</strong> "Evidence of reducing alert noise by >70% in comparable environments" — that's not an aspiration, it's a specific benchmark. Someone knows their current 14,000 alerts at <3% actionable is unacceptable. They've researched what good looks like.<br>
<strong>People cluster (TC-06):</strong> "Cultural alignment evidence" weighted at 25% of the People criterion. Account leadership credentials weighted at 40%. They've been burned by a supplier who put the A-team in the bid and the B-team in delivery.<br><br>
The traumas behind the clusters: vendor who delivered bodies not outcomes, resilience programme that was paperwork not operational, automation promises that didn't materialise.<br><br>

2. Stated vs. Hidden Drivers: What do they say they want (e.g., Innovation) vs. what their role/bonus actually rewards (e.g., Risk Reduction).
3. The 'No-Oriented' Question: Draft a question designed to get them to say "No" to reveal their constraints (e.g., "Is it ridiculous to suggest that cost certainty is more important than feature breadth right now?").
4. Success Definition: Complete this sentence for them: "I will be promoted/bonused next year if this project delivers..."

Feed David Harrison's LinkedIn profile into this prompt alongside the RFP and company research. The motivation map should surface:<br><br>
<strong>Stated vs Hidden:</strong> Harrison posts about operational excellence and systematic improvement. But his hidden driver is the Meridian 2030 delivery milestones — his performance is tied to transforming operations without breaking production. He needs the managed services partner to be operationally disciplined, not innovative for innovation's sake.<br>
<strong>The Black Swan:</strong> His Post #4 says explicitly: "We're not outsourcing this to a consulting firm. Consultants can design. They can't implement operationally." This is a potential BLOCKER signal. If your proposal reads like a consulting pitch, Harrison will resist it. If it reads like an operational delivery plan, he's your ally.<br><br>
If your motivation map didn't flag the outsourcing scepticism as a risk, you missed the most important signal in his profile.<br><br>
