We haven't just created a library (which is passive); we have embedded the specific psychological mechanic of each book into the active prompts and page logic.

Here is the audit of Total Coverage across the site architecture we have just designed.

1. Chris Voss (Never Split the Difference)
The Principle: Tactical Empathy & The Accusation Audit (Clearing the "Safety" driver).

Where it lives:

Week 1 (W1-05): The "Black Swan" profiler.

Week 2 (W2-04): The "Motivation Map" explicitly asks for "No-Oriented Questions."

Week 3 (W3-04): The Executive Summary prompt includes an "Accusation Audit" instruction to address objections upfront.

Appendix: Listed as the primary protocol for the [SAFETY] driver.

2. Barbara Minto (The Pyramid Principle)
The Principle: Answer First (SCQA) & Cognitive Efficiency (Satisfying the "Order" driver).

Where it lives:

Week 3 (W3-04): The Executive Summary generator is strictly enforced with Minto’s "Answer First" structure.

Week 4 (W4-09): The Value Realisation Report demands outcomes before activities.

Appendix: Listed as the primary protocol for the [ORDER] driver.

3. Chip & Dan Heath (Made to Stick)
The Principle: The SUCCESS Model (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories).

Where it lives:

Week 3 (W3-01): The Win Theme Generator specifically asks for "Concrete" evidence and "Simple" headlines.

Blueprint Page: The "12-Phase Migration Framework" is the ultimate example of making a complex service "Concrete."

Appendix: Listed as the primary protocol for the [AFFILIATION] driver (giving the champion a sticky story).

4. Timme & Astley (Insight-Led Selling)
The Principle: Executive Epistemology (Speaking the language of the C-Suite/Earnings Calls).

Where it lives:

Week 1 (W1-01): The "9-Pillar Research" prompt explicitly extracts "Stakeholder Language" (Pillar 8).

Foundations Page: Defined as the core of "Judgment" (knowing how they decide truth).

Appendix: Listed as the primary protocol for the [POWER] driver.

5. Mahan Khalsa (Let's Get Real or Let's Not Play)
The Principle: No Guessing & Ruthless Qualification.

Where it lives:

Week 2 (W2-03): The "Requirements Decoder" looks for the intent behind the ask.

Week 4 (W4-04): The "Qualify In/Out" prompt enforces the "No Guessing" rule on resources.

Frameworks Page: Explicitly mapped to "Ruthless Qualification."

6. Kim & Mauborgne (Blue Ocean Strategy)
The Principle: Structural Differentiation (Eliminate/Raise/Reduce/Create).

Where it lives:

Week 3 (W3-02): The "Competitor Intelligence" prompt asks for the "Kill Shot" (Differentiation).

Week 4 (W4-01): The "White Space Analysis" looks for uncontested market space within the account.

Appendix: Listed as the primary protocol for the [ACHIEVEMENT] driver.

7. Sandhurst Doctrine (Followership & Mission Command)
The Principle: Influence without Authority & The Sphere of Control.

Where it lives:

Index Page: Front and center in your bio ("Strategic Operator").

Week 2 (W2-05): The "Authority Map" is designed to find the Winning Coalition (Mission Alignment).

Steer Page: The new "Leader's Sphere" section.

Appendix: Part III is entirely dedicated to the Sandhurst Influence Model.

8. Sol Rashidi (Human Amplification)
The Principle: Preventing Digital Decay & The Steering Principle.

Where it lives:

Steer Page: The entire page concept ("Steer, Don't Drift") is based on this.

Foundations Page: The "IQ + AI + EQ" matrix.

Week 4 (W4-10): The "Continuous Intelligence Monitor" is the operational fix for Digital Decay.

The Verdict:
Yes. The site is no longer just a collection of prompts; it is a Unified Behavioral Architecture. Every page and every prompt traces its lineage back to one of these core principles.

Show me the new prompt. I will check if it fits this architecture or if it introduces a new principle we need to account for.
