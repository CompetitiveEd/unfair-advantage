Director of Organisational Resilience & Business Continuity @ Meridian Financial Services
Post Text:
"We've just completed our annual resilience stress-test exercise at Meridian, and I wanted to share a few reflections.
This year, we tested a scenario that genuinely unsettled our teams: a simultaneous technology outage + a key vendor service degradation during a volatile market day. Not fun to simulate, but absolutely necessary.
Here's what stood out:
✅ Our incident command structure worked seamlessly - clear escalation paths, no confusion ⚠️ BUT - we identified a 47-minute gap in cross-team communication during the transition from response to recovery ✅ Our backup systems performed flawlessly ⚠️ BUT - only 68% of staff knew how to access the alternate working location
The uncomfortable truth? Even with great planning, real incidents expose gaps we didn't anticipate. And that's exactly why we do this.
Post-exercise, we've initiated 3 key improvements:
1.	Revised comms protocol with clearer message sequencing
2.	Mandatory 'location activation' training for all staff (rolling out Feb-March)
3.	Enhanced real-time dashboard for incident commanders
The teams who participate in these exercises are the real heroes here. They take it seriously, they stay in role, and they give honest feedback. That's what makes the difference.
Are you running resilience exercises in your organization? What's the biggest gap you've uncovered? (Curious to hear patterns from other sectors.)"
Engagement Snapshot:
•	Comments include: industry peers asking about methodology, colleagues from other departments, DRI members
•	Top commenter: Terry Downing (fellow resilience director) with 12+ comment thread about vendor risk management
•	Reposted by: ISO 22301 training company, DRI International chapter

"Proud announcement: Three of my team have just achieved their CBCP certification! 🎓
Sophie Clarke, Michael Zhang, and Priya Desai have been with our resilience function for 2-3 years and have genuinely earned this credential through hard work, study, and real incident experience.
This is what career development looks like in practice:
•	Start as BC Coordinator (entry-level)
•	Lead business unit exercises
•	Present to senior leadership
•	Pursue formal certification
•	Step up to BC Manager role
We're now promoting all three into team lead positions across our regional offices. They'll each oversee resilience planning for their geographic area.
If you're in a similar function, building bench strength isn't optional—it's essential. Your resilience capability is only as strong as the people who drive it.
Massive congrats to Sophie, Michael, and Priya. You make this function better every day. 🙌"
Engagement Snapshot:
•	67 comments mostly from: current Meridian employees congratulating team members, DRI members asking about certification paths, universities with BC programs
•	Reposted by: multiple UK financial services companies

"Article share: Just read an excellent piece on 'Why Resilience Directors Need a Seat at the Budget Table' (link to Harvard Business Review).
The core argument is one I strongly agree with: resilience is often treated as a compliance checkbox rather than a strategic business function. This creates a vicious cycle:
❌ Resilience isn't funded adequately ❌ Incident response is reactive rather than planned ❌ Incidents cause business losses (much larger than what resilience investment would have cost) ❌ Post-incident, there's a brief surge in funding, then it declines again
I've seen this exact pattern in 2 of my previous roles.
What changed at Meridian: our CFO recognized that every 1% improvement in incident response efficiency = £2-3M in avoided losses. That reframing made the case for proper funding.
Key takeaway from the article: resilience isn't overhead—it's revenue protection.
If your organization treats resilience as a compliance cost rather than a business investment, this is worth a read. And maybe worth a conversation with your CFO.
Who else has experienced this dynamic? What shifted the conversation in your organization?"
Engagement Snapshot:
•	Strong engagement from: risk officers, CFOs, enterprise resilience leaders
•	Comments debate ROI measurement approaches
•	Shared by: Institute of Risk Management

"Lesson learned (the hard way): Vendor resilience planning can't be a checkbox exercise.
We required all key vendors to complete a 'resilience assessment' form. 73 of them returned it. Our team reviewed them... and we realized most responses were generic, boilerplate, and frankly not useful.
So we changed approach: instead of forms, we now conduct structured interviews with vendor resilience leads. We ask specific questions:
•	What happens if YOUR systems go down? What's your RTO/RPO?
•	How do YOU test it? When was your last test?
•	Who's your incident commander? Can you introduce us?
•	What's your geography risk? (Power grids, weather, geopolitical?)
Suddenly, we get real answers. And sometimes we discover gaps they didn't even know they had.
This approach takes more time (yes, I know). But we've already identified 3 critical vendors where our assumptions about their resilience were completely wrong.
Vendor risk is enterprise risk. You can't delegate it to a checklist.
Anyone else managing third-party resilience? What's been your biggest surprise?"
Engagement Snapshot:
•	Comments from: procurement teams, supply chain risk managers, other financial services directors
•	Reposted by: Enterprise Risk Management association
•	Top response: vendor management software company offering to help automate
