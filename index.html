            <h2>From "Deal Architect" to AI-Augmented Closer</h2>
            <p>I still wake up replaying the deals I lost. In 15 years of leading enterprise sales—scaling services businesses at a <strong>sustained double-digit CAGR</strong> and winning mandates for <strong>multiple Tier-1 UK and Global financial institutions</strong> (UBS, LBG)—I've learned that technology doesn't win deals. Judgment wins deals.</p>
            
            <p>But the math has changed. AI allows us to compress 4-hour research loops into 20 minutes. This is about building a systematic <strong>Intelligence Layer</strong> that allows you to articulate a client's world better than they can.</p>

                <h3>The Multiplier Effect</h3>
                <p>I don't just use these frameworks; I operationalize them for teams. In 2023, a member of my direct team was recognized as the <strong>#1 Rookie globally</strong>, outperforming thousands of peers across the global organization.</p>
