Professional Audit: hownottogain.co.uk
Let me review the site first, then give you the honest assessment you're asking for.


Searched the web


Let me check the LinkedIn profile and newsletter for additional context.

I have enough information now to give you a thorough, honest audit. Let me write this up properly.


Check the docx skill for best practices
I'll create this as a comprehensive document.


Created a file, ran a command, read a file
Here's my honest assessment. The short version:

Credibility: 7/10 | Positioning Clarity: 5/10 | Differentiation: 8/10 | Market Alignment: 7/10

The profile is genuinely differentiated — the National Grid systems engineer → Commercial Director arc is unique and the technical foundation makes the AI positioning credible rather than performative. The £790M is plausible when you do the maths across 38 years of portfolio ownership.

The biggest problem isn't credibility — it's positioning confusion. The site is trying to serve recruiters, consulting buyers, and newsletter readers simultaneously, and none of them get a clean path. A recruiter sees newsletter CTAs and thinks "consultant." A consulting buyer sees CV-format career history and thinks "between jobs."

The three highest-impact fixes: clarify the primary audience, expand the Brillio narrative (the exit needs more context), and trim by ~30% (the 1987 reference works once, not four times).

Verdict for both hiring and consulting: Interview — but the site is currently working harder than it needs to for that outcome.

heres the new html - all done ?

I've reviewed the updated HTML. You've already implemented several of my recommendations:

What's improved:

"Cumulative" added to £790M — now reads ">£790M Cumulative Career Impact." That's the right fix.
Current Availability section added — clearly states full-time vs consulting, with specific parameters (£100M+ portfolios, 90-day sprints). This directly addresses the positioning confusion I flagged.
Brillio exit context expanded — "Role concluded following strategic shift to US-centric model. I build growth engines; the new model required maintenance." That's a clean, confident framing.
1987 references trimmed — the methodology section now leads with "Automation isn't new" rather than hammering the 1987 point repeatedly. Better.
Newsletter CTAs reduced — still a few, but less aggressive than before.
What's still worth addressing (if you want to push further):

The "I built my first automated commission system in 1987. It still works." line near the bottom of the author card is the one remaining 1987 echo that could go. You've already made the point above — this reads as a punchline looking for a laugh rather than adding credibility.
The trailer/overlay — the "Cost of Inertia" splash screen is a bold choice. It works if your primary audience is browsing deliberately (newsletter readers, people who've been sent the link). It's a risk if a recruiter lands here from LinkedIn and hits a gate before seeing any content. Worth A/B testing mentally: would you put a splash screen on a CV?
Three newsletter CTAs remain (hero, author card, bottom section). Two would be tighter — I'd cut the one in the author card since that section now does heavy lifting on availability.
But honestly? Yes, this is materially better. The positioning is clearer, the claims are better framed, and the availability section solves the biggest structural problem. Ship it.

no net yet !   🎯 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY What makes it "McKinsey enough":  85% McKinsey rigor Structure, language precision, evidence presentation all pass Hero dramatics and colored cards add engagement without sacrificing credibility  What makes it work for hiring:  Shows pattern recognition (two portfolios, same playbook) Demonstrates system thinking (Performance Engineering) Proves repeatability (talent system outcomes) Bridges old-school rigor + new AI capability   💬 COMMUNICATION NOTES  David prefers discussion before implementation "Agreed" = execute immediately "Hmm" = something's wrong, dig deeper Job search urgency (needs site ASAP) Cannot name companies publicly (legal/commercial sensitivity) Can reference where people went (Econocom, Pega, etc.) ## PROJECT OVERVIEW  **Client:** David Matthews   **Goal:** Build portfolio website to land Commercial Director role   **Site Purpose:** Prove methodology (GAIN), not sell consulting   **Workflow:** Claude (strategy/copy) → Gemini Flash (code execution) → User implements **Target Audiences:** 1. Millennials: Know AI, need frameworks + experience 2. Experienced sellers: Know frameworks, need AI execution 3. Directors/CFOs: Need someone who can scale both ## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT CLAUDE  - David is job hunting (needs this ASAP) - McKinsey language = dry, factual, no fluff - "Repositioning" not "transformation" - Never use contribution £ numbers publicly - Gemini Flash has a habit of "optimizing" - be VERY explicit - David prefers discussion before changes (don't jump to solutions) - Visual hierarchy matters (bento boxes, spacing, breathing room)  ---  ## COMMUNICATION STYLE  David is: - Direct, no-nonsense - Prefers "yeah" / "agreed" when aligned - Will challenge if something's wrong - Wants McKinsey-level precision - Values speed (job search urgency)  When he says "let's debate first" → STOP and discuss, don't build   When he says "agreed" → Execute immediately   When he says "hmm" → Something's not right, dig deeper

Got it. No changes made — just reviewed.

I've read your design philosophy and communication notes. A few things I want to flag for discussion before we do anything:

On the "McKinsey enough" point: The site sits at about 85% as you say. The 15% gap isn't the coloured cards or hero dramatics — those work. It's the newsletter CTAs. McKinsey doesn't have subscribe buttons on their consultant bios. Every CTA that says "JOIN THE PRIVATE BRIEFING" pulls the register slightly from "hire me" toward "follow me." That's the tension, not the visual design.

On the trailer overlay: This is the one element I'd want to debate. For your two primary audiences (recruiters clicking from LinkedIn, CXOs sent your link), a gate before content is friction. A recruiter with 30 tabs open will bounce. The content behind the gate is strong — the Cost of Inertia framing is good — but it could live as a section on the page rather than a barrier to entry.

On what's working well: The availability section you added is the single biggest improvement. It resolves the "is he a consultant or a candidate" question in three lines. The Brillio exit framing ("I build growth engines; the new model required maintenance") is confident without being defensive. The cumulative tag on £790M was necessary and you've done it.

Question for you: What's the priority — getting the site live as-is, or iterating on the points above first? Given job search urgency, I'd say ship what you have and treat the trailer and CTA count as v2 refinements. But that's your call.

no -  i have to do the foundaions page and week 1 - intelgence - load all the prompts ! so rather get to a good place on landing - first - please be really explicit in any debate and you know why i am doing flash 3.5 was a little lax -  i have access to gem pro also

00:47
Right. Let's get the landing page tight before you build out Foundations and Week 1.

Here are the specific changes I'd make, with my reasoning. Push back on any of them.

1. Kill the trailer overlay.

This is the strongest opinion I have. Here's why:

A recruiter clicks your LinkedIn profile link. They see a black screen with "The Cost of Inertia" and a button they have to click before seeing anything. They don't click. They close the tab. You've lost them.

The Cost of Inertia content is good — the £500K and 4,000 hours figures are compelling. But they should be a section on the page, not a gate. Move that content to sit between the hero and the bento boxes, or use it as the page opener above the hero. Remove the overlay entirely.

Specific implementation: Delete the entire #trailer-overlay div. Delete the unlockExperience() function and session storage logic. Remove the content-reveal class gating. The page should load directly into the hero.

2. Reduce newsletter CTAs from three to one.

Currently you have:

Hero section: "JOIN THE PRIVATE BRIEFING"
Author card: "Join the Private Briefing"
Bottom section: "JOIN THE PRIVATE BRIEFING"
For a hiring-focused site, one is enough. Keep the bottom one only — it's the natural end-of-page action. Remove the hero CTA and the author card CTA.

Why this matters: Every newsletter button signals "content creator" not "Commercial Director." A recruiter scanning the page shouldn't see three invitations to subscribe. They should see proof points and a way to contact you. The author card already has "Connect on LinkedIn" — that's the right CTA there.

3. Restructure the author card availability section.

What you have is good. But the emoji icons (⚡🚀) undercut the McKinsey register. Replace them with clean formatting:

CURRENT AVAILABILITY

→ Full-Time Leadership: Actively interviewing for Commercial Director / CRO roles (£100M+ portfolios)
→ Consulting: Open to select 90-Day "VAR-to-Services" Transformation Sprints
Simple arrows or bullets. No emoji. The content is strong — let it speak without decoration.

4. Cut "I built my first automated commission system in 1987. It still works."

This line sits in the author card just above the Foundations link. It's trying to be a memorable one-liner but it reads as a quip. You've already established the 1987 credentials multiple times by this point on the page. The link to Foundations should just be:

See the 30-Year System & Calculator →
No setup line needed.

5. The "Two portfolios. Same playbook." separator.

You currently have two thin separator bars stacked:

"Two portfolios. Same playbook."
"Commercial Director | Proven repositioning methodology | Enterprise + Services portfolios"
These should be one bar, not two. Combine them:

Two portfolios. Same playbook. | Commercial Director | Enterprise + Services repositioning
One line. One separator. Cleaner.

6. The formula line "EQ + IQ + AI = SALES PERFORMANCE"

This is in the hero. I'd cut it. It reads like a LinkedIn headline, not McKinsey. The hero headline ("STOP USING AI TO WRITE. START USING IT TO SEE.") is strong and specific. The formula dilutes it with something generic. The subtext line ("The strategic advantage in enterprise sales isn't content generation. It's intelligence synthesis.") already does the job better.

That's the list. In priority order:

Kill the overlay (highest impact — you're losing visitors)
Reduce newsletter CTAs to one (positioning clarity)
Cut the formula line (hero tightening)
Merge the two separator bars (visual cleanup)
Remove emoji from availability (McKinsey register)
Cut the 1987 quip (repetition)
What do you want to debate?

nope i want the code-  what files do you need  - css and index ?

00:49
Yes — give me the CSS and I'll produce both the updated index.html and updated styles.css with all six changes implemented.

I already have the index.html from what you uploaded. Just need the CSS file.

Building both files with all six changes. Let me work through this carefully.


Created 2 files, read a file
All six changes implemented. Here's exactly what changed in each file:

index.html:

Trailer overlay — entire #trailer-overlay div deleted. page-container now has content-reveal class hardcoded so it's visible immediately.
Hero newsletter CTA — removed the formula line, the "Weekly newsletter" text, and the "JOIN THE PRIVATE BRIEFING" button from the hero. Hero now ends cleanly after the subtext.
Two separator bars — merged into one: Two portfolios. Same playbook. | Commercial Director | Enterprise + Services repositioning
Author card availability — emoji replaced with → arrows in var(--primary) colour. Colon removed from "Current Availability" header (cleaner).
Author card 1987 quip — deleted "I built my first automated commission system in 1987. It still works." Link now just reads See the 30-Year System & Calculator →
Author card newsletter CTA — removed "Join the Private Briefing" button. Only "Connect on LinkedIn" remains.
Bottom section — kept as the single newsletter CTA. Made the "Connect via LinkedIn" text a clickable link.
JS cleaned — removed unlockExperience(), session storage logic, and content-reveal toggling. Simplified scrollToTop(). Trajectory bars fire on page load at 300ms.
styles.css:

Removed entire #trailer-overlay section (section 08)
Removed .overlay-hidden class
Removed .page-container opacity/transition gating — it's just visible now
Removed .formula class (no longer used)
Removed mobile trailer overlay styles from the @media block
Adjusted bento animation delays from 1.5s/1.7s down to 0.5s/0.7s (no longer waiting for overlay dismissal)
Renumbered CSS sections (08 is now Animations, 09 Utility, 10 Responsive)

            In 1987, at National Grid, I built "self-healing" systems using Unix scripts and SQL. We didn't call it AI then; we called it <strong>Systems Architecture</strong>.
