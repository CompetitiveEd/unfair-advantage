            <h2>I Still Wake Up Replaying the Deals I Lost</h2>
            <p>Not because I didn't work hard — I did everything right: researched, prepped, connected. But the client chose the competitor.</p>
            <p>That mirror moment stings: Did I truly understand their world? Did I prove it in the room? Could deeper, faster intel have changed the outcome?</p>
            <p>The information was always there — annual reports, LinkedIn posts, earnings calls, investor decks. They publish their priorities, pressures, unspoken fears.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>The real question isn't availability. It's: How do I cut through the data storm quickly enough to turn insight into genuine human connection?</strong></p>

        <section class="split">
            <h2>Here's the Uncomfortable Reality</h2>
            <p>The market is splitting — fast.</p>
            <p><strong>One side:</strong> sellers still trapped in 4-hour manual research loops.</p>
            <p><strong>The other:</strong> those who use AI to surface what matters in 20 minutes, then layer on 10+ years of pattern recognition and relationship depth to close.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Positions blending technical literacy + commercial acumen + strong interpersonal skills. These multi-skilled profiles are rare and in high demand. AI fluency will be assumed. Output will matter more than titles."</p>
                <cite>— Marc Sumner, Robertson Sumner (January 2026)</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Your decade of scars, pattern recognition (IQ), and hard-earned client empathy (EQ) is already the hardest piece.</p>
            <p>AI-natives have speed and tech fluency — but they lack your judgment and trust-building muscle. Add AI to what you already own, and you become the complete profile they're desperately hunting.</p>
            <p><strong>That's not competition. That's your unfair advantage.</strong></p>
